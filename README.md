# littlepoland

A smaller (toy) Reverse Polish Notation implementation. The core code is ~60
lines long (and thus the code serves as adequate documentation).

littlepoland uses float64 numbers throughout.

An example command-line program lives in the `lcalc` directory. Once compiled,
it can be run like:

`lcalc 1 2 + 4 \* 3 /`
